												<h4>Gauss--Bonnet theorem: using riemannian geometry tools </h4> 
												<h5>(August 2021 - August 2023)</h5>
												<p> The Gauss--Bonnet Theorem is one of the most renowned and profound theorems in differential geometry, linking global topological invariants with local geometric properties—two distinct quantities. In this work, we utilize tools from Riemannian geometry (Levi-Civita connection, sectional curvature, and differential forms) to understand and demonstrate this celebrated theorem. </p>
